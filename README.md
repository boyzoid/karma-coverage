# Karma Coverage Demo

This is a small demo to show how you can check how well your code is covered by tests.

## Installing Dependencies

Execute the following command in the directory where you just checked out this code

```apacheconf
npm install
```

If you want to make it easier to run Karam, install the CLI globally

```apache
npm install -g karma-cli
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command

```apache
karma start my.conf.js
```
